Stock Portfolio Prediction App 📈

This Flask web application provides stock portfolio insights by displaying portfolio weights, predicting future stock prices, and estimating portfolio returns. The app generates random predictions as placeholders, which can later be replaced with real stock price predictions using a machine learning model or an external API.

Features
📊 Portfolio Weights Display: Predefined stock allocations shown in a table.
📈 Future Stock Price Predictions: Simulated prices for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, and TSLA.
🔄 Future Portfolio Returns: Randomized return predictions.
🌐 Web-based Interface: Built using Flask and rendered with Jinja templates.
🚀 Live Prediction Updates: Clicking the /predict route regenerates predictions.

Tech Stack
🐍 Python (Flask, Pandas, NumPy)
🖥 HTML & Jinja (for rendering tables)
🔥 Future Scope: Can be enhanced with real stock price data using APIs or ML models.
